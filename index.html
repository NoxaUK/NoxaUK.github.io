        <h2>What is a Mortgage?</h2>
        <p>A mortgage is a loan used to purchase a home or other real estate property. The borrower (the person buying the property) agrees to pay back the loan over a specified period of time, usually with interest. The property serves as collateral for the loan, which means that the lender (the bank or other financial institution) can seize the property if the borrower fails to make payments.</p>

        <h2>Applying for a Mortgage</h2>
        <p>To apply for a mortgage, you'll need to provide personal and financial information to the lender, including your income, employment history, and credit score. The lender will use this information to determine how much you can afford to borrow and what interest rate you qualify for. It's important to have all of your documents and information organized before you apply to make the process as smooth as possible.</p>
